### Python 3 tool for Arduino Mega-based EEPROM writer

This is a (partial...) Python 3 conversion of the tool by "Chris Baird" provided here:

For the EEPROM reader/writer described here:

Circuit boards / kits are available from the original designer here:

I've only tested this with my own hand-built version and Microchip 28C64A.
